 A text based guide to aid the user through VTOL, a Mod Manager for the Northstar client for Titanfall 2

# Main Menu
![vtol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CooldudePUGS/VTOL-Guide/main/images/vtol-main-window.png)
**The Main Menu of VTOL is where you'll probably spend most of your time.**\
This menu has a lot of useful information, such as the version of VTOL you have, the version of Northstar you have, if the Master Server is online, whether EA App/Origin are currently open, and a place to set your game path. 

## Version Numbers
You can see what version of VTOL/Northstar you have in the top left of the VTOL window

## Master Server/EA or Origin online
These small tabs show you whether the Master Server for Northstar is currently online, and if EA or Origin is running properly on your computer. If the EA/Origin tab is red, solving that will be covered later. If you are unsure if you have EA or Origin, you have EA

## Northstar Instalation/Locate Titanfall 2 Install
The final parts of the Main Menu are at the bottom, showing your game's directory with a button to Locate Titanfall 2 Install, a small button next to this, and a button reading Update +Northstar

# Installation Via VTOL
VTOL handles most things automatically, but still requires minimal setup. Something you will have to do manually is locate your Titanfall 2 Install. You can do this by pressing the button of the same name on VTOL, and navigating to your Titanfall 2 directory (If you're unsure of what your game path is, check out the Northstar wiki's [Default Directories](https://r2northstar.gitbook.io/r2northstar-wiki/installing-northstar/troubleshooting#game-location) section)\

After doing this, press (ADD THIS LATER IDK WHAT IT IS LOL)

# Installing Mods Via VTOL
VTOL has a built in browser for searching [Northstar's Thunderstore page](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/) (the website where most Northstar mods get uploaded to), located at the second section on the left hand side of VTOL. You will see the newest uploaded mods here by default, which you can change by applying filters (Note: The sorting is by default Low-High for filters. You can change this by pressing the button with an arrow next to the filters button, making it High-Low)

VTOL also has support where all you need to do is drag and drop a mod downloaded from the Thunderstore page onto the Mods tab (the second tab on the left side) to automatically install the mod

# Settings
On the way bottom of the left side of VTOL, there is a button to open settings for the VTOL manager. You will want to keep most of these on default, but change them as you wish. It is normal for the "Restart_As_Admin" button to appear untoggled. This is also where you can tick "Enable_EA_APP_Usage" to make the client work better with the EA app, assuming you have it and not Origin

# Skins
VTOL has support for skins formatted for an older version of Northstar, normally requiring an extra tool. All you need to do is drag the folder of one of these old format skins onto the Skins tab (the fourth tab on the left side) to install it automatically

# Server
This section allows you to add Launch Arguments to your client. It is recommended that for the client, you add [launch arguments](https://r2northstar.gitbook.io/r2northstar-wiki/installing-northstar/troubleshooting#launch-opts) via the store you own the game on.

For the dedicated server option, you can scroll through this tab to set many different options for a server which can be found on the Northstar Wiki's [Server Hosting Guide](https://r2northstar.gitbook.io/r2northstar-wiki/hosting-a-server-with-northstar/basic-listen-server)

# Tools
This section is meant for those trying to create mods for Northsar. The first tab is a screen where you can locate your mod folder, and easily set up things such as the Name, Description, and Icon to be shown on the Thunderstore page when you go to upload your mod.\

The second tab is IDK WHAT THE HELL THIS IS LOOK AT IT LATER LOL\

The third tab is an implementation of Spoon's [Adovate Tool](https://github.com/ASpoonPlaysGames/Advocate), where you can convert an old style skin mod to a mod that can be installed by everyone like a normal mod. Please give credit to the original skin owner while doing this. (If confused, following the earlier link to Github describes how to set up Advocate)

The fourth tab lists a lot of commonly used tools by modders to help create mods easier. You can get more info about each tool by clicking the Information icon in the top right of the image for each respective tool.
